# Spaceteroids

Hello everyone!
    
My name is Stanislav Shergin (aka Claner/Cizerion). Thanks for playing this game! 
This is my "Java skill researching" project named as "SP/ACE\TEROIDS". 
Game was grown through my Java learning interests and Java FX framework. 
For this projects i took free visual and sound game assets from different authors 
on different sites. All authors with appropriate links were specified in CREDITS.TXT 
file. "SP/ACE\TEROIDS" is not commercial project and actually it has only studying 
Java and portfolio creating aims. 

Thanks to all who noticed this project!

With best regards, Stanislav.

# Test the game

Note: Before run i recomended to install Java 8 on your PC.

I added runnable Spaceteroids.jar file so that now you can test this game without 
building project. On OS Windows go to the command line, change directory 
to one where Spaceteroids.jar file lies (using "cd" command) and type 
"-java -jar Spaceteroids.jar", then press enter. Game should start.
