# Spaceteroids

    Hello everyone!
    
    My name is Stanislav Shergin (aka Claner/Cizerion). Thanks for playing this game! This is my "Java skill researching" project named as "SP/ACE\TEROIDS". Game was grown through my Java learning interests and Java FX framework. For this projects i took free visual and sound game assets from different authors on different sites. All authors with appropriate links were specified in CREDITS.TXT file.  "SP/ACE\TEROIDS" is not commercial project and actually it has only studying Java and portfolio creating aims. 
    
    Thanks to all who noticed this project!

    With best regards, Stanislav.
